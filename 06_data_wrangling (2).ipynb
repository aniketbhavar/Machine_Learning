    "\n",
    "In the last two assignments you've explored data with both basic statistical methods and different types of data visualization.  While this is a key part of the data analysis process, datasets need to be in the right format before analysts can start drawing meaningful conclusions.  The process of preparing data for analysis is called __data wrangling__, and often takes the bulk of an analysts' time during a data project.  Possible issues might include: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Missing data or problematic/incorrect values in a dataset; \n",
    "* Data are formatted incorrectly, preventing the analyst from working with the data in the right way; \n",
    "* Data are spread across multiple files or data tables; \n",
    "* Data are in the wrong \"shape\" for analysis and visualization\n",
    "* All of the above, in varying capacities!\n",
    "\n",
    "A major reason why you are learning to work with `pandas` in this course is because it can flexibly handle all of these tasks.  In this notebook, we'll be going over some basic examples of how this works, which you'll then put into practice with the Exercises at the end.  \n",

At this point, while you might not know yet what insights are contained in the data, you will have some sense of the research questions that you are interested in.  As your research questions don't likely require all 122 columns, you can safely restrict your dataset to only those columns that you need for your analysis.  Our core research question is as follows: \n",

In this notebook, we'll be focusing on the methods that allow us to accomplish the task at hand, and you'll be learning a few new methods as well.  \n",

For example, had I assigned the results of the subsetting operation back to `full`, and I later decided that I needed an additional column from the original data frame, I'd need to read the whole thing in again rather than just add a column name to the list `keep`.  Python will hold all of our data _in memory_, so it will be accessible to us throughout our Python session; given that our data are relatively small, this won't cause us any problems.  Bigger data workflows might require different methods, however.  \n",

Our column names in our data frame are simply a list of strings, which we've learned how to work with already with string methods. As such, we can use __list comprehension__ to convert all of the column names to lower case: "

    "### Creating new columns\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a categorical column from a quantitative column requires computing a new column in our data frame, which will be a common part of your workflow in __pandas__.  As you learned in class, you can use basic mathematical operations to create new columns from existing ones.  In this example, we are going to organize our universities into __bins__ based on their size, and then compare universities across those bins.  \n",
    "\n",
    "__pandas__ includes a lot of methods for creating new columns; we're going to discuss here options for organizing our data into bins.  The three options are as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Equal interval: all bins have the same width, regardless of the number of observations in each bin.  \n",
    "* Manual breaks: the analyst specifies where the bin breaks should be located\n",
    "* Quantile: An equal number of observations are organized into a specified number of bins; bins widths will in turn be irregular.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Equal interval and manual breaks are available via the `cut()` function in __pandas__; quantiles are available from the `qcut()` function.  Let's create a new column with the `.assign()` method that organizes the values in `ugds` into five quantiles, labeled with 1 through 5 which we accomplish with `range()`: "
